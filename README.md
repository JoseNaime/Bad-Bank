## Instalation
These steps are to start running the project on a local machine
1. Download/clone this project
2. Execute ```npm install``` in the current folder and after dependencies get installed, run ```npm start```
3. Go to the `client` folder by running the following command ``` cd client```
4. Repeat step 3 inside the `client` folder and in a different command line
5. Go to your browser and open `https://localhost:3000/` (must be the client URL)

As the server is configured as a proxy of the react project, they'll work together. That's why it's necessary to run the server and client separately
